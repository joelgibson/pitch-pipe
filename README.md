# Pitch Pipe

A pitch pipe with a frequency analyser and just-intonation intervals: see it live at <https://www.jgibson.id.au/articles/pitch-pipe/>, and read the [blog post](https://www.jgibson.id.au/blog/pitch-pipe/).

To run locally:

    pnpm install
    pnpm run dev


## TODO

- Smooth the attack/release of the waves so they don't pop in or out.
- Heisenbug when locking/unlocking phone when installed to home screen.
